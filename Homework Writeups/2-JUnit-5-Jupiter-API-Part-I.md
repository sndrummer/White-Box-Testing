# Intro

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with the JUnit 5 Jupiter API. After the homework, a student should be able to:

* Add the JUnit 5 dependency to a Maven project
* Write JUnit 5 tests
* Run JUnit 5 tests from the command line or IDE

# Part I (75 points)

Complete the [JUnit 5 Jupiter API Tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/j-introducing-junit5-part1-jupiter-api/) (note that you only need to complete the tutorial on this specific page). At the end of the tutorial, create, add, and commit the following files to your local repository of the tutorial:

1. The captured output from the command-line run
2. A new summary.md file that discusses key points you learned from the tutorial

Create a patch against the original repository with all your changes.

# Part 2 (25 points)

In [Tooling and Course Policies](Tooling-and-Course-Policies.md) you submitted a patch against a very simple project. For this part of the homework, add to that project:

1. [The Maven dependencies for JUnit 5 Jupiter](https://howtodoinjava.com/junit-5-tutorial/)
2. A few arbitrary JUnit 5 tests
3. A capture of the output from running the tests from the command-line with Maven.

Create a patch against the repository as it was at the [Tooling and Course Policies](Tooling-and-Course-Policies.md) submission showing only the now changes in this homework.
Submission

Create a zip-file with both patches and upload that file as the submission.
